## Week 1 Quiz - Introduction to deep learning

1. What does the analogy “AI is the new electricity” refer to?

    - [x] Similar to electricity starting about 100 years ago, AI is transforming multiple industries.
    </br>***Note:&nbsp;AI is transforming many fields from the car industry to agriculture to supply-chain...***
    - [ ] Through the “smart grid”, AI is delivering a new wave of electricity.
    - [ ] AI is powering personal devices in our homes and offices, similar to electricity.
    - [ ] AI runs on computers and is thus powered by electricity, but it is letting computers do things not possible before.

2. Which of these are reasons for Deep Learning recently taking off? (Check the three options that apply.)

    - [x] We have access to a lot more computational power. 
    </br>***Note:&nbsp;The development of hardware, perhaps especially GPU computing, has significantly improved deep learning algorithms' performance.***
    - [x] We have access to a lot more data.
    </br>***Note:&nbsp;The digitalization of our society has played a huge role in this.***
    - [ ] Neural Networks are a brand new field. 
    - [x] Deep learning has resulted in significant improvements in important applications such as online advertising, speech recognition, and image recognition.
    </br>***Note:&nbsp;These were all examples discussed in lecture 3.***
    
3. Recall this diagram of iterating over different ML ideas. Which of the statements below are true? (Check all that apply.)

    - [x] Being able to try out ideas quickly allows deep learning engineers to iterate more quickly. 
    </br>***Note:&nbsp;As discussed in Lecture 4.***
    - [x] Faster computation can help speed up how long a team takes to iterate to a good idea. 
    </br>***Note:&nbsp;As discussed in Lecture 4.***
    - [ ] It is faster to train on a big dataset than a small dataset.
    - [x] Recent progress in deep learning algorithms has allowed us to train good models faster (even without changing the CPU/GPU hardware). 
    </br>***Note:&nbsp;For example, we discussed how switching from sigmoid to ReLU activation functions allows faster training.***

4. When an experienced deep learning engineer works on a new problem, they can usually use insight from previous problems to train a good model on the first try, without needing to iterate multiple times through different models. True/False?
    - [ ] True
    - [x] False
    </br>***Note:&nbsp;Finding the characteristics of a model is key to have good performance. Although experience can help, it requires multiple iterations to build a good model.***
